# Java_Quiz

This specific repo includes a java quiz. Using dom manipulation, questions are added, clicks are tested to an array of correct answers, and a score is given at the end of the quiz. A page was set up for final results including a high score, but for some reason I couldn't get the local storage feature to cooperate so it was abandoned.
